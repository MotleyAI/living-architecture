# refactor Specification

## Purpose
Verified refactoring for both languages: `dr-refactor` rewrites a rename or move across a project,
`dr-compliance` reports what would make that rewrite unverifiable, and `dr-mock-lint` keeps test doubles
type-bound, so the type-check ratchet plus the tests prove nothing was missed.

## Requirements

### Requirement: dr-* inputs are routed by file language
`dr-refactor`, `dr-compliance` and `dr-mock-lint` SHALL route each input file to the twin of its language,
decided by the registry's source extensions. `dr-refactor`'s language SHALL be the language of `--file`
(`rename`, `move-symbol`) or `--module` (`move-module`); a source of an unregistered extension, a `--dest`
of another language, or a `--module` directory whose expansion holds more than one language, SHALL exit 1 with a
finding. For `dr-compliance` and `dr-mock-lint`, an explicit file of
an unregistered extension, or matching the language's `declaration_globs`, SHALL be skipped with a warning on
stderr; a directory SHALL expand only to files of the repo's languages, or of every registered language when the repo has none, excluding `declaration_globs` and
`excluded_dirs`. The other language's files SHALL run in its twin with the same working directory. Output
SHALL be one block per language in registry id order, each exactly as that language's twin prints it alone;
stderr SHALL be relayed; the exit code SHALL be the maximum. When the other twin cannot run or fails with exit
2 or a signal, the command SHALL print nothing on stdout, report the failure as the forwarding rules
define, and exit 2.

#### Scenario: Python-only repo directory expansion is unchanged
- **WHEN** `dr-compliance src` runs in a repo whose only repo language is Python and `src` also holds `app.js`
- **THEN** only the `.py` files are checked and stdout equals today's golden

#### Scenario: Mixed explicit files
- **WHEN** `dr-mock-lint tests/test_a.py web/a.test.ts` runs through either twin, both files violating
- **THEN** stdout is the Python block followed by the TypeScript block, identical for both invoking twins, and the exit code is 1

#### Scenario: Declaration file skipped
- **WHEN** `dr-compliance types/api.d.ts` runs
- **THEN** a warning names the skipped file on stderr and the exit code is 0

#### Scenario: Relative paths from a subdirectory
- **WHEN** `dr-refactor --project .. rename --file src/a.ts --name foo --new-name bar` runs through the PyPI twin from a subdirectory
- **THEN** the forwarded run resolves every path against the same working directory and the output equals the npm twin's own run

#### Scenario: Cross-language destination
- **WHEN** `dr-refactor move-symbol --file pkg/a.py --name foo --dest web/b.ts` runs
- **THEN** it exits 1 with the cross-language finding and changes nothing

#### Scenario: Mixed-language directory refused
- **WHEN** `dr-refactor move-module --module pkg --dest lib` runs and `pkg` holds both `.py` and `.ts` sources
- **THEN** it exits 1 with a mixed-language finding and changes nothing

### Requirement: Refactor output format
`dr-refactor` SHALL print a header naming the refactor, then one unified diff per changed file sorted by
path (`--- a/<path>`, `+++ b/<path>`, three context lines, no end-of-file marker), a `rename from` / `rename
to` pair for every moved file, then the dry-run or applied footer. Every header, footer and error SHALL come
from the findings registry; no checker or library message text SHALL be printed. The diff format SHALL be
pinned by shared vectors that both twins pass, covering a missing final newline, CRLF line endings, created
and deleted files, and paths with spaces or non-ASCII characters.

#### Scenario: TS rename dry-run
- **WHEN** `dr-refactor rename --file src/a.ts --name foo --new-name bar` runs on a project where `src/b.ts` imports `foo`
- **THEN** stdout is the rename header, the diffs of `src/a.ts` and `src/b.ts` in path order, and the dry-run footer naming 2 files, and no file changes

#### Scenario: Diff vectors
- **WHEN** either twin's suite runs
- **THEN** its diff formatter reproduces every shared diff vector byte for byte

### Requirement: TypeScript refactors are computed per project
The TypeScript `dr-refactor` SHALL load the tsconfig named by `index.yaml`'s `typescript.tsconfig` when set;
otherwise, as TypeScript's own tooling does, it SHALL look at the `tsconfig.json` files from the source file's
directory up to `<project>` and take the outermost one whose reference graph contains the file (a solution
config), else the nearest one. It SHALL load every project in that reference graph, each with its own compiler
options. `dr-compliance` and `dr-mock-lint` SHALL pick each input file's tsconfig the same way.
An `architecture/index.yaml` that exists but is not valid UTF-8 or not valid YAML SHALL be an error, never a reason
to fall back: a duplicate key SHALL be reported with the `c4.index-duplicate-key` wording, any other problem with
the `c4.index-invalid-yaml` wording, and the command SHALL exit as for a named tsconfig that does not exist. Only a
missing `index.yaml`, or one that names no tsconfig, SHALL fall back.
A source file SHALL belong to the first project in depth-first preorder that contains it; a file in no project
SHALL exit 1. A rename SHALL be computed in every project that contains or references the owning project;
identical edits SHALL be merged, and differing edits to one span SHALL exit 1. The whole change set SHALL be
computed and validated before any write: overlapping edits, a move onto an existing path, or a missing
destination SHALL exit 1 with nothing written. A dry-run SHALL never write. The TypeScript used SHALL be the
twin's bundled one; target-repo code SHALL never be loaded.

#### Scenario: Rename across project references
- **WHEN** a solution tsconfig references `core` and `app`, `app` imports `foo` from `core`, and `foo` is renamed in `core`
- **THEN** the edits in both projects are printed

#### Scenario: tsconfig below the project root
- **WHEN** `index.yaml` names no tsconfig, `<project>` has no `tsconfig.json`, and `web/tsconfig.json`
  includes `web/src`
- **THEN** `dr-refactor` and `dr-compliance` on `web/src/a.ts` use `web/tsconfig.json`'s project and options

#### Scenario: Duplicate key in the index
- **WHEN** `architecture/index.yaml` repeats a key and `dr-refactor`, `dr-compliance` or `dr-mock-lint` runs on a TS
  file
- **THEN** it prints `index.yaml is not valid YAML: ` followed by the duplicate-key message, exits as for a missing
  named tsconfig (1 for `dr-refactor`, 2 for `dr-compliance` and `dr-mock-lint`) and writes nothing

#### Scenario: Invalid index YAML
- **WHEN** `architecture/index.yaml` is not valid YAML or not valid UTF-8 and `dr-refactor` runs on a TS file
- **THEN** it prints `index.yaml is not valid YAML`, exits 1 and writes nothing

#### Scenario: Projects with different compiler options
- **WHEN** `app` uses a `paths` alias that `core` does not declare
- **THEN** the alias import in `app` is rewritten by the rename

#### Scenario: File outside every project
- **WHEN** `--file` names a TS file no project includes
- **THEN** it exits 1 with the outside-project finding

#### Scenario: Move onto an existing file
- **WHEN** `--apply move-module --module src/a.ts --dest lib` runs and `lib/a.ts` exists
- **THEN** it exits 1 with the collision finding and no file changes

### Requirement: TypeScript locators
`--line` and `--col` SHALL be 1-based and `--offset` 0-based; columns and offsets SHALL count Unicode code
points, and a column SHALL count within its line excluding the line terminator. A line, column or offset out
of range SHALL exit 1 with a finding. `--name` SHALL select the first declaration named NAME in document order
(function, class, interface, type alias, enum, variable, method or property), else the first identifier NAME;
none SHALL exit 1 with the symbol-not-found finding. No locator SHALL exit 1 with the no-locator finding.

#### Scenario: Astral character before the symbol
- **WHEN** a line is `const s = "😀"; const foo = 1;` and `--line 1 --col 22` points at `foo`
- **THEN** `foo` is renamed

#### Scenario: Column out of range
- **WHEN** `--col` exceeds the line's length plus one
- **THEN** it exits 1 with the out-of-range finding

### Requirement: TypeScript rename
`rename` SHALL rename every reference the TypeScript language service finds, including overrides and
implementations across the hierarchy, and SHALL keep the shape of shorthand properties and import/export
aliases. Strings and comments SHALL NOT be rewritten. `--no-in-hierarchy` and `--unsure include` SHALL exit 1
with a not-supported finding; the default `--unsure skip` SHALL be accepted. A symbol that cannot be renamed,
such as one declared in a library or a declaration file, SHALL exit 1 with a stable finding.

#### Scenario: Override renamed with its base
- **WHEN** `Base.run` is renamed and `Child extends Base` overrides `run`
- **THEN** both methods and every call site are renamed

#### Scenario: Shorthand property keeps its key
- **WHEN** a local `foo` used as `{ foo }` is renamed to `bar`
- **THEN** the object becomes `{ foo: bar }`

#### Scenario: Hierarchy flag refused
- **WHEN** `rename --no-in-hierarchy` runs on a TS file
- **THEN** it exits 1 with the not-supported finding and changes nothing

#### Scenario: Library symbol
- **WHEN** the location is a reference to `Array.prototype.map`
- **THEN** it exits 1 with the cannot-rename finding

### Requirement: TypeScript move-symbol and move-module
`move-symbol` SHALL apply the language service's move-to-file refactor for a top-level declaration into the
existing `--dest` file, rewriting every import of it. Every re-export of the moved symbol, named, default or
through `export *`, SHALL resolve to the new file. A location with no applicable move SHALL exit 1 with a
not-movable finding. `move-module` SHALL move a file or directory into the existing `--dest` directory and
rewrite every import of it.

#### Scenario: Move a function with importers
- **WHEN** `--apply move-symbol --file src/a.ts --name foo --dest src/b.ts` runs and `src/c.ts` imports `foo` from `./a`
- **THEN** `foo` is in `src/b.ts`, `src/c.ts` imports it from `./b`, and the applied footer lists the changed files

#### Scenario: Default export and re-export
- **WHEN** the moved symbol is a default export re-exported by `src/index.ts`
- **THEN** every importer and the re-export resolve to the new file

#### Scenario: Barrel re-export
- **WHEN** `src/index.ts` has `export * from './a'` and `foo` moves from `src/a.ts` to `src/b.ts`
- **THEN** `src/index.ts` re-exports `foo` from `./b`

#### Scenario: Not movable
- **WHEN** the location is inside a function body
- **THEN** it exits 1 with the not-movable finding

#### Scenario: Move a directory
- **WHEN** `--apply move-module --module src/util --dest src/lib` runs
- **THEN** `src/util` becomes `src/lib/util` and every import of it is rewritten

### Requirement: Compliance check sets are per language
Each language's `dr-compliance` checks SHALL be listed in the language registry. Without `--select`, every
check of each file's language SHALL run. A selected id that no language lists SHALL exit 2; a selected id that
only another language lists SHALL not apply to a file. Python's checks SHALL be `untyped-def`,
`unannotated-attr`, `mock` and `rope-walk`. On files rope's walker fully covers, Python's output SHALL be
unchanged.

#### Scenario: Python default unchanged
- **WHEN** `dr-compliance pkg` runs without `--select` in a Python repo whose files rope's walker fully covers
- **THEN** stdout equals today's golden

#### Scenario: Language-specific id
- **WHEN** `dr-compliance --select explicit-any pkg/a.py` runs
- **THEN** nothing is reported and the exit code is 0

#### Scenario: Python-only id on a TypeScript file
- **WHEN** `dr-compliance --select rope-walk web/a.ts` runs through either twin
- **THEN** nothing is reported and the exit code is 0

### Requirement: TypeScript compliance checks
The TypeScript checks SHALL be: `tsconfig`, one finding per governing tsconfig and per flag whose effective
value after `extends` resolution is not true, among `strict`, `noImplicitAny` and `noImplicitOverride`;
`explicit-any`, every `any` type in the file; `untyped-def`, every parameter, binding element or rest parameter
whose type is implicitly `any` as the type checker determines it with `noImplicitAny` in force (return types
are not required); and `mock`, the TypeScript mock-lint rules. `--attr NAME` SHALL report `x.NAME` accesses
whose receiver's type is `any`. Findings SHALL be sorted per file; a file that does not parse SHALL produce the
parse-error finding.

#### Scenario: Strict disables an implied flag
- **WHEN** a tsconfig sets `strict: true` and `noImplicitAny: false`
- **THEN** one `tsconfig` finding names `noImplicitAny` and another names `noImplicitOverride`

#### Scenario: Inherited flags
- **WHEN** a tsconfig extends a base that sets `strict` and `noImplicitOverride`
- **THEN** no `tsconfig` finding is reported

#### Scenario: Contextually typed callback
- **WHEN** a file has `items.map((x) => x.id)` with `items: Item[]` and `function f(a, { b }) {}`
- **THEN** `untyped-def` reports `a` and `b` and not `x`

#### Scenario: Attribute blind spot
- **WHEN** `--attr id` runs on a file with `function g(o: any) { return o.id }`
- **THEN** the access `o.id` is reported

### Requirement: TypeScript mock lint
TypeScript `dr-mock-lint` SHALL flag: `fn()` on `vi` or `jest` with neither a type argument nor an
implementation; `mock`, `doMock` or `unstable_mockModule` on `vi` or `jest` with a factory whose module is not
given in the typed form (Vitest: an `import('…')` first argument; Jest: a `typeof import('…')` type argument),
or whose `import('…')` does not resolve; and, in files matching the test globs, a double assertion `as unknown
as T` or `as any as T`. A call without a factory, or with only an options object, SHALL pass. `vi` and `jest`
SHALL be recognized only when bound to an import from `vitest` or `@jest/globals` (aliases included) or to the
unshadowed global. There SHALL be no waiver.

#### Scenario: Bare fn
- **WHEN** a test has `const f = vi.fn()`
- **THEN** it is reported; `vi.fn<typeof g>()` and `vi.fn(() => 1)` are not

#### Scenario: Untyped module factory
- **WHEN** a test has `vi.mock('./api', () => ({ get: vi.fn<typeof get>() }))`
- **THEN** it is reported; `vi.mock(import('./api'), …)` and `vi.mock('./api')` are not

#### Scenario: Shadowed receiver
- **WHEN** a file declares its own local `vi` and calls `vi.fn()`
- **THEN** nothing is reported

#### Scenario: Double assertion in a test
- **WHEN** `a.test.ts` has `const db = {} as unknown as Db` and `src/a.ts` has the same line
- **THEN** only the test file's line is reported

### Requirement: Python refactors walk every source construct
The Python `dr-refactor` SHALL compute every refactor over modules that rope's source walker fully covers. Every
syntax node SHALL be walked, except expression contexts, operators, `with` items and the internals of f-strings
and t-strings. Every string literal SHALL be covered over its full source text, including every piece of an
implicit concatenation and any `r`/`b`/`u`/`f`/`t` prefix in any order and case; covering surrounding parentheses
as well is allowed. This SHALL hold for every construct of the Python versions the package supports. The
following SHALL be refactored like any other code:
- annotations of parameters, `*args`, `**kwargs` and returns, in `def` and `async def`;
- `lambda` parameters of every kind;
- PEP 695 type parameters with bounds and defaults;
- class keywords;
- the `else` of `try/except/else/finally`;
- string literals with `rb`-style prefixes;
- f-strings implicitly concatenated with other literals;
- Python 3.14 t-strings.

Source positions SHALL be compared in characters, so non-ASCII text anywhere in a module SHALL NOT break a
refactor.

#### Scenario: Annotated parameter with a keyword default inside the annotation
- **WHEN** `dr-refactor rename` runs on a project whose module holds `async def probe(p: Annotated[_Payload | None, Field(description="param text")] = None) -> str:`
- **THEN** it prints the rename's diff and exits 0

#### Scenario: f-string concatenated with a literal holding a parenthesis
- **WHEN** a module of the project holds `c = g(f"{d}" "(")`, or a call whose argument is `"…'QueryFinish' "` followed by `f"AND user = '{u.name}' "` and `"AND query LIKE '%getSetting(%readonly%'"`
- **THEN** a rename in that project prints its diff and exits 0

#### Scenario: Class keywords and try-else-finally
- **WHEN** a module holds `class A(B, metaclass=M, x=")"):` and a `try` with `except`, `else` and `finally` blocks whose bodies hold strings with parentheses
- **THEN** a rename of a name used in both prints every occurrence and exits 0

#### Scenario: t-string on Python 3.14
- **WHEN** the twin runs on Python 3.14 and a module holds `f(t"{a}(", ")")`
- **THEN** a rename of `a` prints its diff and exits 0

#### Scenario: Non-ASCII text before an annotation
- **WHEN** a module holds `def f(s: str = "😀", p: A[F(d="(")] = None) -> str: ...`
- **THEN** a rename of `p` prints its diff and exits 0

### Requirement: A Python walker gap is refused with a located finding
When rope's walker fails on a module while the Python `dr-refactor` computes a refactor, or leaves part of it
uncovered, `dr-refactor` SHALL stop. It SHALL print the `refactor.rope-walk` finding on stderr, naming the file
and the line of the construct, and exit 1. It SHALL write no file, with or without `--apply`, and print no rope
or library message text. The line SHALL be:
- the start line of the first uncovered syntax node or string literal in source order;
- else the start line of the first top-level statement the walker cannot cover on its own;
- else 1.

A gap that does not crash SHALL be refused like one that does. Any other failure SHALL NOT be reported as a
walker gap.

#### Scenario: Gap reported at the construct, not at the drift
- **WHEN** the walker leaves a parameter annotation on line 3 uncovered and its token search fails on line 9
- **THEN** stderr is `refactor.rope-walk` naming the module and line 3, the exit code is 1 and no file changes

#### Scenario: Apply writes nothing on a gap
- **WHEN** `dr-refactor --apply rename …` hits a walker gap in any module it analyses
- **THEN** it exits 1 with `refactor.rope-walk` and every file of the project is unchanged

#### Scenario: Silent gap refused
- **WHEN** the walker finishes a module without error but leaves a string literal's tail uncovered
- **THEN** `dr-refactor` exits 1 with `refactor.rope-walk` naming that literal's line

### Requirement: A Python dry-run writes nothing
The Python `dr-refactor` without `--apply` SHALL leave the project tree unchanged. In particular it SHALL NOT
create rope's `.ropeproject` folder. With `--apply`, it SHALL change only the files the refactor rewrites,
creates, moves or deletes.

#### Scenario: No rope folder after a dry-run
- **WHEN** `dr-refactor rename --file pkg/a.py --name foo --new-name bar` runs on a project without `.ropeproject`
- **THEN** the project still has no `.ropeproject` and no file changes

#### Scenario: No rope folder after an apply
- **WHEN** the same rename runs with `--apply`
- **THEN** only the renamed files change and no `.ropeproject` is created

### Requirement: Python rope-walk compliance check
The Python `dr-compliance` check `rope-walk` SHALL walk each file as `dr-refactor` would. For every file the
walker cannot cover, it SHALL report one `compliance.rope-walk` finding at the line `dr-refactor` would name. A
file that does not parse SHALL get only its `parse-error` finding.

#### Scenario: Every formerly failing construct passes
- **WHEN** `dr-compliance --select rope-walk` runs on files holding every construct of "Python refactors walk every source construct"
- **THEN** nothing is printed and the exit code is 0

#### Scenario: Uncoverable file listed
- **WHEN** the walker cannot cover `pkg/a.py` at line 3, and `pkg/b.py` is clean
- **THEN** stdout is the single `compliance.rope-walk` line for `pkg/a.py` and line 3, and the exit code is 1

#### Scenario: Parse error takes precedence
- **WHEN** `dr-compliance` runs on a `.py` file with a syntax error
- **THEN** only its `parse-error` finding is printed

### Requirement: Refactors edit only at references
In both languages, a file that `dr-refactor` touches SHALL change only within these permitted regions: the span of each
resolved reference to the renamed or moved module or symbol; the import item holding such a reference (its whole
statement, or its whole line, when it is the statement's only item); one inserted import statement directly after a
referencing import statement or after the leading import block; and, for `move-symbol`, the moved code's region.
Every other byte SHALL be unchanged: no import SHALL be reordered, merged, hoisted or reformatted, and no
non-import statement SHALL move. A `from` import SHALL be split only when exactly one of its names moves. CRLF line
endings and a missing final newline SHALL be preserved.

#### Scenario: importorskip-gated import stays gated
- **WHEN** `move-module` or `move-symbol` runs and a touched test file has `x = pytest.importorskip("x")` followed by
  `import x.y`
- **THEN** both lines keep their positions and text, and the only changed lines are the moved references

#### Scenario: Non-import statement between import groups
- **WHEN** a touched file has `sys.path.insert(0, ".")` between two import groups and one group imports the moved
  module
- **THEN** the statement and both groups keep their order, and only the referencing import line changes

#### Scenario: Unsorted import block untouched
- **WHEN** a touched file's import block is not in sorted order and one line imports from the moved module
- **THEN** only that line's module path changes, and every other line of the block is byte-identical

#### Scenario: Module rename leaves the shapes intact
- **WHEN** `rename` renames module `client` to `cli2` across files holding the gated, interleaved, unsorted,
  multi-name and function-local import shapes
- **THEN** only the module name tokens and the uses bound to them change

#### Scenario: TypeScript import split in place
- **WHEN** `move-symbol` moves `f` out of `src/a.ts` and `test/t.ts` has `import { g, f } from "../src/a.js";`
  followed by other imports and a statement between import groups
- **THEN** that line becomes `import { g } from "../src/a.js";`, the next line imports `f` from the new file, and
  every other line is byte-identical

### Requirement: Python moves rewrite each reference minimally
For a Python `move-module` or `move-symbol`, each occurrence of the moved module or symbol SHALL be handled by
exactly one rule, decided from the objects its names resolve to:
1. An import statement naming the old path (absolute or relative, at any scope, including `from old import *` and
   package-prefixed paths) SHALL have its path rewritten in place, keeping its alias, bound names, comments and layout.
   A relative import SHALL stay relative, recomputed from the importer's new location and the target's new location.
   It SHALL become absolute only when the target cannot be reached relatively. A relative import between files that
   move together SHALL be unchanged. In a `from` import where exactly one name moves, that name SHALL be removed in
   place, and the moved name SHALL get a new `from` statement, with its alias, on the line after the statement ends,
   at the same indentation.
2. A use whose binding still resolves after the move SHALL be unchanged. Such a binding is a name bound by a rule-1
   import, or a name another module binds explicitly (by import or assignment).
3. A use whose binding no longer resolves after the move SHALL be rewritten. Such a use reaches a submodule only as a
   package attribute, or reaches the moved symbol through its old module or a star import of it. A dotted use SHALL
   become the new dotted path, and `import <new module>` SHALL be added on the line after the import binding the
   chain's root. A bare name bound by a star import SHALL stay as it is, and `from <new module> import <name>` SHALL be
   added on the line after the star import. No import SHALL be added where that scope already binds the same object.
An import binding SHALL be removed in place only when every use of it was rewritten by this refactor. For
`move-symbol`, an import of the source module SHALL also be removed in place when every use of it lay in the moved
code. In the source module, a `__all__` entry naming the moved symbol SHALL be removed, and a remaining use of the
symbol SHALL get `from <dest> import <name>` after the leading import block. In the destination, the imports the moved
code needs SHALL be added after the leading import block. An import of the symbol from the source SHALL be removed in
place, and each use of a name it bound under an alias SHALL become the symbol's name. The leading import block is the
first contiguous run of import statements, ending at the first non-import statement; in a file without imports it is
the position after the module docstring and `__future__` imports. Edits
SHALL be located by source character, so non-ASCII text before them on the line does not shift them. When an
added import or the moved code would bind a name that already resolves to a different object in that scope,
`dr-refactor` SHALL exit 1 with the name-conflict finding naming the file and line, and SHALL write nothing.

#### Scenario: Multi-name from-import split in place
- **WHEN** `move-module` moves `pkg/sql/client.py` to `pkg/database` and a file has
  `from pkg.sql import dialects, client` between `import sys` and `import os`
- **THEN** that line becomes `from pkg.sql import dialects`, the next line is `from pkg.database import client`, and
  every other line is byte-identical

#### Scenario: Parenthesized from-import with per-name comments
- **WHEN** the moved name sits on its own line, with a comment, inside a parenthesized multi-line `from` import with a
  trailing comma
- **THEN** only that line is removed, the other names and their comments stay, and the new statement follows the
  closing parenthesis

#### Scenario: Function-local import rewritten in place
- **WHEN** a function body holds `from pkg.sql import client  # ALLOW(import-not-top)` and uses `client.X`
- **THEN** only that import's module path changes, the use is untouched, and no module-level import is added

#### Scenario: Use through another module untouched
- **WHEN** a file uses `sql_client.engine_factory`, and `sql_client` is a module that imports the moved
  `engine_factory` by name
- **THEN** the use is unchanged and no import is added to the file

#### Scenario: Self-aliased import
- **WHEN** `move-module` moves `pkg/a/mod.py` to `pkg/b` and a file has `import pkg.a.mod as mod` and `print(mod.X)`
- **THEN** the import becomes `import pkg.b.mod as mod`, the use is unchanged, and the command exits 0

#### Scenario: Dotted use through the moved module's own import
- **WHEN** a file has `import pkg.sql.client` and uses `pkg.sql.client.X`
- **THEN** they become `import pkg.database.client` and `pkg.database.client.X`, and no import is added

#### Scenario: Use through a package attribute
- **WHEN** a file has `import pkg.sql as sql_pkg` and uses `sql_pkg.client.X`, and `pkg/sql/__init__.py` does not
  import `client`
- **THEN** the use becomes `pkg.database.client.X` and `import pkg.database.client` is added on the line after
  `import pkg.sql as sql_pkg`

#### Scenario: Symbol reached through a module alias
- **WHEN** `move-symbol` moves `f` from `pkg/a.py` to `pkg/b.py` and a file has `import pkg.a as pa` used only as
  `pa.f()`
- **THEN** the use becomes `pkg.b.f()`, `import pkg.b` replaces `import pkg.a as pa` in place, and every other line
  is unchanged

#### Scenario: Old module import with another surviving use
- **WHEN** the file in the previous scenario also uses `pa.g()`
- **THEN** `import pkg.a as pa` stays, `pa.g()` is unchanged, and `import pkg.b` is added on the next line

#### Scenario: Star-import consumer
- **WHEN** `move-symbol` moves `f` out of `pkg/a.py` and a file has `from pkg.a import *` and calls `f()`
- **THEN** `from pkg.b import f` is added on the line after the star import, and the call is unchanged

#### Scenario: Re-export keeps exporting
- **WHEN** `pkg/__init__.py` has `from pkg.a import f as public_f` and `pkg/a.py`'s `__all__` lists `"f"`
- **THEN** the re-export becomes `from pkg.b import f as public_f`, and `"f"` is removed from `pkg/a.py`'s `__all__`

#### Scenario: Relative import stays relative
- **WHEN** `pkg/sql/engine.py` has `from . import client` and `pkg/sql/client.py` moves to `pkg/database`
- **THEN** the import becomes `from ..database import client`

#### Scenario: Moved module's own relative imports
- **WHEN** the moved `pkg/sql/client.py` has `from . import dialects`
- **THEN** in `pkg/database/client.py` it becomes `from ..sql import dialects`

#### Scenario: Package move keeps internal relative imports
- **WHEN** `move-module` moves package `pkg/sql` to `pkg/database` and `pkg/sql/client.py` has `from .dialects import D`
- **THEN** that line is unchanged in `pkg/database/sql/client.py`

#### Scenario: Move across top-level packages
- **WHEN** a relative import's target moves to another top-level package
- **THEN** the import becomes absolute

#### Scenario: Import edit forms
- **WHEN** an import of the moved module is backslash-continued, follows a semicolon on its line, or sits in a file
  with CRLF line endings, no final newline, or non-ASCII text earlier on the line
- **THEN** only the module path changes, and line endings, the final-newline state and the other statement are
  preserved

#### Scenario: Destination imports added without reflow
- **WHEN** `move-symbol` moves `f`, which uses `os`, into a destination whose import block is unsorted and gated by
  `importorskip`
- **THEN** `import os` is added after the destination's leading import block, and no existing line moves

#### Scenario: Destination already binds the needed module
- **WHEN** the destination already has `import os`
- **THEN** no import is added

#### Scenario: Name conflict refused
- **WHEN** `move-symbol` moves `f`, which uses module `os`, into a destination where `os` is assigned another value
  or bound by an aliased import of another module; or a function-local `import pkg.a as pa`, whose `pa.f()` needs
  `import pkg.b`, sits in a function where `pkg` is a parameter or is bound by an enclosing function
- **THEN** it exits 1 with the name-conflict finding naming that file and the existing binding's line, and no file
  changes
