name: pr-implement
description: Stage 3 of 4 of the /la:pr flow — implement until every test from the pr-tests stage passes, then with the user's explicit go-ahead commit, push, and open the PR. Normally dispatched by /la:pr; if the /la:pr context (BRANCH, CHANGE_ID, OPENSPEC, tracker issue) is not already loaded in this session, invoke the la:pr skill instead.
---

**Preflight:** run `la-doctor --expect 0.2.1 --require-config` once per session before using any `la-*` or `dr-*` command. If it reports the missing-config finding (the one naming `/la:init`), run the fast path of the `la:init` skill, then re-run this preflight; stop and show the user its output on anything it still reports, or on any other failure.

**Stage 3 of 4 of the `/la:pr` flow.** Prerequisite: `/la:pr` has run in this
session and established `BRANCH`, `CHANGE_ID`, `OPENSPEC`, and the full tracker
issue (body + comments), if there is one. If any of that is missing, invoke the `la:pr` skill
instead — it rehydrates and dispatches back here. The `/la:pr` stopping policy
applies throughout this stage.

Before writing anything, recover the durable plan (the
`openspec/changes/<CHANGE_ID>/` folder when `OPENSPEC=1`, else the plan
comment on the tracker issue) and the failing tests already on disk from
`pr-tests`.

## Step 1 — Implement until tests pass

Implement the plan. Run the repo's test command (`la-config get commands.test`; if unset, the repo's documented full non-integration suite) after changes and fix any failures. Do not
declare done until every test from the `pr-tests` stage passes.

**Symptom vs. structural cause — decide before you patch.** The plan already
chose between a band-aid and a structural fix; implement the structural shape
it chose, and do not quietly degrade it into instance patches to get tests
green faster. If, while implementing, a test failure or the code itself
reveals that the planned fix is a band-aid after all — the same change must be
repeated in N places, two code paths have to agree by hand, a missed
normalization that a single canonical representation would obviate, an
axiom-violating shape left standing (judged against the principles/axioms in
the `architecture/**/*.arc42.md` files) — STOP and present the case to me: the
symptom, the structural cause, the band-aid vs. structural options with
PROS/CONS, the arc42 grounding, and your RECOMMENDATION (leaning structural —
a bigger diff is an acceptable cost). Wait for my call (this is the
design-decision pause permitted by the `/la:pr` stopping policy). If the
failure is genuinely local with no structural cause, just fix it. Never
silently ship a band-aid over a structural problem, and never undertake a
large structural refactor the plan did not include without my go-ahead.

Intermediate local commits during implementation are fine within reason — e.g.
to merge origin/main before editing, or to checkpoint a coherent working state.
Keep them tidy (specific `git add`, never `git add -A`); they can be reorganized
before the push. The go-ahead gate in Step 3 governs **pushing** and **opening
the PR**, not every local commit.

If `OPENSPEC=1`, tick off `openspec/changes/<CHANGE_ID>/tasks.md` as you complete
each task (the same checklist authored in `pr-plan` — this is the
`apply` phase, driven by TDD here instead of `/opsx:apply`).

When writing code, follow the `la:concise-comments` skill: no design essays,
ticket-ID-on-every-line, or code-restating comments; docstrings to a line.
Rationale belongs in the spec / PR description / the tracker issue — not in
code — so verbose comments never get written in the first place.

## Step 2 — Local gates (before commit)

Once the suite is green, run the SAME deterministic gates `pr-review` uses, so
the review bots don't have to redo them and the first push is already clean.
Both are HARD GATES: do not proceed to Step 3 while either is RED.

**Conventions.** There is no PR yet at this stage, so diff against the default
branch with `--base`:

```
la-check-conventions --base <default-branch>
```

What it checks and how to fix each finding is described once, in the
`la:process-reviews` skill (its conventions gate section); follow it. An
`import-not-top` waiver must be confirmed with me BEFORE landing it. Re-run
until green.

**Type check.** Run `la-typecheck`. It checks each applicable language against
its committed baseline, and exit 1 means this change added errors outside it.
The baseline is a ratchet:
- never re-record it (`--write-baseline` exists only to adopt the gate once);
- fix every new error at its root, never by loosening types or adding a
  suppression; a per-line suppression with a reason (`# pyright: ignore[rule]`,
  `// @ts-expect-error`) is a solve only when the checker is wrong (a false
  positive) or the wrongness is deliberate (e.g. an invalid-input test);
- it only shrinks: when a file you touch carries baselined errors that
  root-fix without much churn, fix those too, and commit the baseline
  `la-typecheck` shrinks.

`la-typecheck` printing "nothing to check" means no language applies, which is
not a failure. Re-run until green.

## Step 3 — Ask me to push and open the PR

Once all tests pass AND both local gates are green, stop and ask me whether
to push and open a PR (folding in any final commit of the implementation).
Intermediate local commits along the way were fine (Step 1), but **pushing** and
**opening the PR** need my explicit go-ahead — do not do either on your own.
Then follow the standard commit/PR workflow (specific `git add` for each new
file, never `git add -A`).

If `OPENSPEC=1`, the whole `openspec/changes/<CHANGE_ID>/` folder is part of the
change — `git add` it explicitly alongside the code (proposal, design, tasks,
delta specs). Do NOT archive yet — that happens once the review loop has
converged, just before I merge (`pr-review`).

**Always merge the PR's destination branch before creating the PR.** After
committing and before the push, bring the PR's envisioned base branch (the branch
the PR will target — usually `main`) into `BRANCH`, so the PR opens against, and
CI runs on, the current destination rather than a stale base: `git fetch origin
<base>` then `git merge origin/<base>`. Commit any local changes first, then
merge — NEVER stash, NEVER rebase; the merge message's
first line must name the merged ref in single quotes, e.g. `Merge branch
'origin/main' into <BRANCH>`. Resolve any conflicts, re-run the local gates
(full non-integration suite, conventions and type check) on the merged tree, and only then
push and `gh pr create`. If the base has not advanced since your last merge the
merge is a no-op — proceed straight to the push.

**Write the PR description for a human reader**, not as a spec dump. Concise but
complete prose: what the change does and why, the user-facing behaviour it adds
or changes, and — where it makes the change concrete — a short runnable example
or two (a query plus what it now returns, or a before/after). Cover anything a
reviewer needs to understand and evaluate the change; skip what they don't.
Do NOT paste `openspec show --diff`, the raw delta specs, or the tasks
checklist — the change folder is committed in this PR, so whoever wants the full
spec surface reads it there. Link the tracker issue (GitHub: `Closes #<N>`).

## Step 4 — Hard stop

> **🛑 HARD STOP (reset point 3 of 3) — just after the PR is created.** Code,
> tests (green, local gates clean), and the change folder are committed and
> the PR exists. Say we're at reset point 3 and STOP — do not start the review
> loop. I'll `/clear` and re-invoke `/la:pr`, which will detect and run
> `pr-review`.
