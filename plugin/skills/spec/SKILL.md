description: Spec-driven change flow for a task given to an agent. Always pulls in the Linear issue whose `gitBranchName` matches the current git branch exactly, and combines it with whatever the user typed when invoking the skill. Rehydrates context, detects the current stage, and dispatches to the stage skills la:spec-plan → la:spec-tests → la:spec-implement → la:spec-review.
---

**Preflight:** run `la-doctor --expect 0.1.0` once per session before using any `la-*` or `dr-*` command; if it fails, stop and show the user its output.

I want a detailed spec-driven flow. The brief is the union of:
1. The Linear issue tied to the current branch (see "Rehydrate" below), AND
2. Whatever I just typed when invoking this skill.

## The four stages

The flow runs as four stage skills in this fixed order, and I reset the
session (`/clear`) between stages. Each stage ends at a hard stop; everything
a fresh session needs is on disk or in Linear, so any stage can resume from
just the branch name:

1. **`spec-plan`** — interview me, Codex-review the plan, emit the
   OpenSpec change (OpenSpec repos only), make the plan durable.
   Ends at 🛑 reset point 1 (before tests).
2. **`spec-tests`** — write the full failing test suite for the plan,
   Codex-review the tests against the plan.
   Ends at 🛑 reset point 2 (before implementation).
3. **`spec-implement`** — implement until every test passes, then (with my
   go-ahead) commit, push, and open the PR.
   Ends at 🛑 reset point 3 (just after the PR is created).
4. **`spec-review`** — run `/la:process-reviews` until converged, then
   archive the OpenSpec change (OpenSpec repos only) so I can merge.

This skill does NO stage work itself. It only: rehydrates context (below),
detects which stage we're at, and invokes that stage's skill (`la:<stage>`) via
the Skill tool. Run exactly ONE stage per session — when its hard stop is reached, STOP;
never chain into the next stage, even if it looks quick.

## Stopping policy

Each stage skill ends with its own **hard stop** so I can reset your context.
At a hard stop: say which reset point we're at, then STOP and wait — do not
start the next stage. I'll `/clear` and re-invoke `/la:spec` (possibly with
"continue on branch `<BRANCH>`"); rehydration + stage detection below take it
from there.

**Within a stage, run autonomously — do NOT stop or ask permission to
proceed.** The only other permitted pauses are:
- the **`spec-plan` interview** (its whole point is questioning me);
- a **nontrivial design decision** — a real fork with more than one reasonable
  option — raised with explicit PROS/CONS + RECOMMENDATION (per the interview
  rule in `spec-plan`). A choice with an obvious default is NOT this:
  take the default and move on;
- the standing **go-ahead gate before push/PR** (`spec-implement`): never
  push or open a PR without my explicit go-ahead;
- a **suspected unrelated gap** — a failure, restriction, or missing capability
  that looks pre-existing or outside this change's scope (a bind-level refusal, an
  allowlist, a fixture that cannot express a scenario, …). Whether it is unrelated
  and what to do about it is MY call, never yours: STOP and ask, presenting what
  you found, the existing Linear issues you searched for (search first, cite ids
  and titles), and the options (treat as in-scope / xfail against an EXISTING issue
  / narrow the scenario) with a recommendation. NEVER create a Linear issue, mark a
  scenario xfail, or narrow a scenario on your own to route around it — even when a
  tasks.md line or an earlier plan says "file its own issue".

Never stop just to report progress, to confirm an obvious next step, or to ask
something you can determine yourself.

## The plan is frozen once spec-plan ends

The plan — the OpenSpec change folder (proposal, design, tasks, delta specs) or,
without OpenSpec, the finalized-plan comment on the Linear issue — is MINE once
`spec-plan` reaches its hard stop. In EVERY later stage, NEVER change it without
my explicit confirmation of the exact edit: no added or amended decisions, no
rewritten or added scenarios, no "corrections" after a probe, no re-scoping, no
notes folded into tasks. If a stage finds the plan wrong, incomplete, or
contradicted by an axiom or a probe, STOP, present the exact proposed diff with
the reason, and wait. The one self-serve edit is flipping a task's `[ ]` to `[x]`
when it was completed exactly as written.

## Nothing the next stage needs lives in chat

Sessions `/clear` between stages, so the stop message reaches no future stage.
Anything the next stage must know therefore has to be **persisted where that
stage will discover it naturally** during its own rehydration and work — NEVER a
turn-final "heads-up", "note for next time", "FYI for spec-implement", or a
caveat tacked onto the stop message. Such text is gone the instant I `/clear`, so
it only masquerades as a hand-off. If you catch yourself about to write one,
STOP and put it in one of these instead:

- **tasks.md** — an open sub-task, a gotcha, or a calibration note on a step
  (the next stage works through this file);
- **design.md / proposal.md / the spec delta** — a decision, rationale, or a
  constraint on how something must be built;
- **the Linear issue** — the spec in the body, resume state and probe outcomes
  in a handoff comment;
- **the code itself** — a test's assertions plus a terse comment, or a
  pointer to a FUTURE issue that will change it (the only issue reference
  allowed in code) — for anything about how the code must behave.

A hard stop then states only which reset point we're at: everything the next
stage needs is already on disk or in Linear, by construction.

## Commit at the end of every stage

At each stage's hard stop — after the stage's work is done, just before you
STOP — commit the files that stage created or changed, **without asking**. This
overrides any standing "don't commit, I'll commit" / "ask me each time"
preference, and it supersedes any "do NOT commit" wording in the stage
skills. What still holds:

- Stage with **specific named paths** (`git add <path>`, one at a time) — NEVER
  `git add -A`, `git add .`, or a whole directory.
- **Commit only** — pushing and opening the PR still need my explicit go-ahead
  (`spec-implement` Step 3 / the stopping policy above); the end-of-stage
  commit does not.

## Normative harnesses (living-architecture repos)

In a repo with an `architecture/` directory at its root,
`architecture/**/*.arc42.md` and `architecture/**/*.c4` files are normative
harnesses, exactly like tests. This applies at EVERY stage of the flow —
planning, writing tests, implementing, and fixing review findings:

- **Read them first.** Before doing the stage's work, read
  `architecture/index.yaml` plus **every** `*.arc42.md` file relevant to the
  modules the change touches — the node file of each touched node AND
  `system.arc42.md` (cross-cutting principles) — plus the LikeC4 view of every
  touched node (see the `la:living-architecture` skill).
- **Obey them.** Every plan, test, implementation, and review fix MUST obey the
  node principles and the model's import law — or explicitly include the
  model + arc42 update as part of the change.
- **Flag, never deviate.** If anything in an arc42 file seems wrong,
  contradictory, or makes the task impossible or substantially harder, FLAG IT
  TO ME EXPLICITLY and wait for my call — NEVER silently deviate from,
  reinterpret, or ignore a principle, and never produce work that quietly
  conflicts with one.
- **Keep them normative and minimal.** When work strains a principle, first make
  the code comply; propose an edit only when the principle genuinely forbids
  something needed, in the smallest general wording — never descriptive text or
  implementation detail (function names, mechanisms).
- **Never edit without per-change approval.** NEVER create, modify, or delete
  one without my explicit approval for each specific change — present the
  exact edit and wait for my OK. A broader approved plan that mentions the
  edit does NOT count; the concrete edit itself needs the OK.

## Rehydrate — pull in the Linear issue for the current branch

Look up the Linear issue whose `gitBranchName` equals the current git branch
**exactly**. I create branches by clicking "Copy git branch name" in the
Linear issue UI and `git checkout -b`-ing them, so the local branch name is
byte-equal to the issue's `gitBranchName`. That equality is the join key.

1. Capture `BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)`.
2. Try the cheap path first: Linear's auto-generated branch name is
   `<user>/<lowercased-key>-<title-slug>` (e.g.
   `alice/abc-123-add-storage-layer`). Pull out the `<key>` chunk
   (`abc-123`), uppercase it (`ABC-123`), and call
   `mcp__linear__get_issue(id="ABC-123")`.
3. If that returns an issue **and** the returned issue's `gitBranchName`
   equals `BRANCH` exactly, use it. Otherwise fall back to
   `mcp__linear__list_issues(team="<KEY-PREFIX>", query="<key-or-slug>",
   includeArchived=false)` (`<KEY-PREFIX>` = the key's team part, e.g. `ABC`)
   and walk the results, comparing each issue's
   `gitBranchName` to `BRANCH`. Pick the unique exact match.
4. If 0 exact matches: tell me no Linear issue maps to this branch and ask
   whether to proceed with only my typed input as the brief. If >1 exact
   matches: list them and ask which one.
5. Once a match is confirmed, read the issue body in full
   (`mcp__linear__get_issue` already returns it) plus any comments via
   `mcp__linear__list_comments`.
6. **Set the change-id and resolve OpenSpec.** `CHANGE_ID` = `$BRANCH` with any
   leading `<user>/` segment stripped (Linear's copied branch names look like
   `alice/abc-123-add-storage-layer`, so `CHANGE_ID=abc-123-add-storage-layer`;
   OpenSpec change ids forbid underscores, so replace any with `-`). This
   keeps Linear issue ↔ git branch ↔ OpenSpec change 1:1:1. Then resolve OpenSpec:
   - If an `openspec/` directory exists at the repo root and it's healthy, set
     `OPENSPEC=1`.
   - If `openspec/` is **absent or invalid**, ask me whether to initialize this
     repo for OpenSpec now (one-time) or run this change without it. If yes,
     invoke the **`la:openspec-init`** skill (it resolves the CLI and scaffolds the
     corpus), then set `OPENSPEC=1`. If no, set `OPENSPEC=0`.
   - When `OPENSPEC=0`, skip everything marked *"OpenSpec repos only"* in the
     stage skills.

## Detect the stage

Work out which stage this session should run — first match wins:

1. **Open PR for `BRANCH`?** Check with `gh pr view --json state,url`.
   If an open PR exists → **`spec-review`**.
2. **No durable plan yet?** The plan is durable iff:
   - `OPENSPEC=1`: `openspec/changes/<CHANGE_ID>/` exists and
     `openspec validate <CHANGE_ID> --strict` passes; or
   - `OPENSPEC=0`: the Linear issue has a comment containing the finalized
     plan.
   If not durable → **`spec-plan`**.
3. **No tests for this change yet?** Look for test files added/changed for
   this change: the working tree (`git status`) plus commits since the
   merge-base with the default branch
   (`git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD <default-branch>)..HEAD`).
   If none → **`spec-tests`**.
4. **Otherwise** → **`spec-implement`** (plan and tests exist, no PR yet;
   this stage also covers the "all tests already pass, awaiting my
   commit/push/PR go-ahead" case).

If the evidence is ambiguous (e.g. test files changed but they don't obviously
belong to this change), say what you found and ask me which stage to run.

## Dispatch

Tell me in one line which stage was detected and why, then invoke that stage's
skill (`la:spec-plan` / `la:spec-tests` / `la:spec-implement` / `la:spec-review`)
via the Skill tool and follow it to its hard stop. If I explicitly named a stage
when invoking `/la:spec`, that overrides detection.
