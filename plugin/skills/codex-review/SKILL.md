**Preflight:** run `la-doctor --expect 0.2.1` once per session before using any `la-*` or `dr-*` command; if it fails, stop and show the user its output.

If `la-config get reviewers.codex` prints `false`, this repo has turned Codex reviews off: say so, and run the
review only if the user confirms. If the Codex MCP server (`mcp__codex__codex`) is not available, stop and tell
the user; never substitute another reviewer.
